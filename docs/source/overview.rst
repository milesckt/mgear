Overview
========

mGear is a rigging and animation framework for Autodesk Maya. mGear provides a set of convenient modules, tools and c++ solvers to streamline the development of rigging and animation tools.

Originally mGear was design and develope by `Jeremie Passerin <http://www.jeremiepasserin.com/blog/>`_ , since 2013 `Miquel Campos <http://www.miquel-campos.com/>`_ continued the project and evolved to the current design.

				"Miquel did an amazing job making mGear a solid Production tool. I am delighted to see it running smoothly in Maya. Softimage User will be delighted to find their favorite Rig Builder in Maya. Maya user will be amazed how MGear is solid and flexible. Gear has been used in production all around the world since 2010 and changed the life of many riggers and animators, I have no doubt that mGear will have the same success. Do I need to mention it’s free and open source ?"

	from Miquel:
		Big thanks to `Jeremie Passerin <http://www.jeremiepasserin.com/blog/>`_ , he is the real master behind mGear design. I am just following  his steps and continuing what he started.

		Also special big thanks to `Ingo Clemens <http://www.braverabbit.de/>`_ for the OSX solver compilation and `Gaetan Guidet <https://github.com/gatgui>`_ for the Linux solver compilation and guidance in my C++ desert of knowledge.

		Thanks to `Chad Vernon <http://www.chadvernon.com/blog/>`_ , for his fantastic tutorials and open-source tools. Some of mGear's parts wouldn't be possible without it.

		And thanks!! to all the people who help me and support this project :)
